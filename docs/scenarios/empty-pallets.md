# ** Empty Pallet Detection**

> No smoking & No vaping zone enforcements with Vision AI.


## Overview


## Vision AI based monitoring

## Model Details

### Dataset

### Model

### Scenario details

The business logic for this scenario is as follows:

- We use existing camera feeds from the premises to monitor pallets in real-time, allowing it to quickly detect when a pallet is empty.

- VisionAI system is able to run on edge devices. It uses camera feeds for processing.

- When an instance of empty pallet is detected, an alert will be raised.


## Features

- Real-Time Monitoring: The AI model is designed to monitor pallets in real-time, allowing it to quickly detect when a pallet becomes empty. This feature is especially useful in warehouse and logistics settings where timely pallet retrieval is crucial to maintaining efficient operations.

- Customization: The empty pallet detection AI model can be customized to suit the specific needs of different businesses. For example, it can be configured to detect different types of pallets or to operate under different lighting conditions.

- Integration: The AI model can be integrated with other software and hardware systems, such as warehouse management systems, to provide seamless operation and maximize efficiency.

- Scalability: The AI model can be scaled up or down to meet the needs of businesses of different sizes. Whether a business operates a single warehouse or multiple warehouses across different locations, the AI model can be adapted to suit its needs.


## Training with custom data

The scenario is provided as part of our GPL-v3 package for VisionAI. If you wish to train this with custom datasets, please contact us and we can provide you with the training code. You can do custom training with your own datasets for free, as long as it complies with GPLv3 license (you give back the code to the community). If you are interested in a custom license, please [contact us](../company/contact.md).
